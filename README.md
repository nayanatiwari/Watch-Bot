# Watch-Bot

HackMIT 2020 Project

Reddit bot service that users can opt-in to that montiors user's posts for suicidal sentiment (using Machine Learning, Naive Bayes Classifier, IBM Watson). If a suicidal post is detected, the user-defined emergency contacts are notified. This is not for currently high-risk people - suicide prevention lifelines and resources are included throughout the program. Rather, we imagine those who have recently recovered or completed therapy would use this service to keep a continuous check on their mental health.
