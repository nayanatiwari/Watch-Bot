I\u2019m sorry you are feeling this way, too.  I can relate.  Pain is a powerful motivator.  I wish I had a \u201csleep\u201d button.  Dreams are best.  Don\u2019t seem to be depressed and hopeless in dreams. They just happen. Life just happens. Death too.  I hope you can seek out a way to ride out this life with putting yourself into these painful events.  Your stomach still wants to eat. Your lungs still want to breath. Your ears still want to hear and your eyes still want to see.  Your mind wants to dream also.  Sometimes our thinking and feeling mind can\u2019t connect with all the other egos within us.  It\u2019s severely depressing and depersonalizing.  I end up in vegetative states because of it, but when I\u2019m in those I can\u2019t even organize a suicide.  I\u2019m hostage to all my other selves.  Trying different drugs and routines to try to connect the dots.  It\u2019s hard though.  I hope you can hang on and keep trying.

We have an argument almost every day. We even had the same exact argument about cats.\n\nI hate it here. I see no future for myself. How the hell could I ever afford to live independently? How the hell could I ever afford to own my place, to not be under their influence? My whole life is dedicated to leaving Iran because I know I have no chance for living a normal life here, but I know that my family won't support me by any means. We are not that poor of a family, we are middle class and the money that I need for immigration (let's say 40k USD at most), is just about 1/4 of the value of a flat of the entire building my parents own.

It's mainly the feeling of being protected. Not just in the be there for you way, but physically. Even though I'm on the smaller/athletic side and a bit geeky, I am attracted to my opposite. Usually heavier people that are outdoorsy. It's not like a fetish. I guess it came from being raised around guys like that.
