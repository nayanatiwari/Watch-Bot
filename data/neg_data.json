When I first noticed that I thought maybe that was because English isn't my mother tongue, but then I realized that I was stumbling and stuttering in my own language. So I figured out there were a few reasons for that, first is a lack of reading. Basically when I read any book I tend to think clearer and form sentences much easier. Second reason is a state of mind. I mean when I was anxious, nervous, sleepy or any other destructive state or all of the above combined - I could barely form simple sentences. But whenever I felt good mentally I was able to clearly express my thoughts without even spending a split-second to think about what I was about to say. \n\nThese days I feel like I've overcame this problem since I quit smoking and drinking. I got my healthy sleeping mode back on and all of these factors combined make my mind work really well and I don't struggle expressing myself as much as I did.",

I work as an ESL teacher and I'm having a group of little kids aged 7-9. There is a little girl in this group, God she is so sweeeeeeeet! I wish I had a daughter like her, I just can't help but admire her being so cute. I love all the children, but some of them are just like angels.",

Texting with my buddies and family from my hometown helps, but I miss the Sunday family lunches, the Friday night board games with my buddies, everything else, most of all I miss my cats and dogs, as they are in my mom's house.\n\nI know I'm kinda just ranting, but all of that was just to say you're not alone in feeling that way.",
